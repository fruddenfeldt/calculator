- Missing a clear/delete ("c") button
- Missing div within display to show inputs and output

- In the i/o div, a JS function should display (and concatenate?) the numbers clicked on.
    - if I click 1, 2, 3, the display should show 123, not 1 + 2 + 3.
    - it should then store this value, at each step, so that I can perform an operation at any time, like 123 * 2
